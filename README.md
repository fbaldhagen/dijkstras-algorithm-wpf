# Dijkstra and A* Pathfinding Visualization

This project is a WPF application that demonstrates the visualization of Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms. 
The user can interact with the grid to set start and end nodes, add or remove obstacles, and switch between the two algorithms to see how they perform in finding the shortest path.

## Features

- Interactive grid allowing users to set start and end nodes, as well as obstacles.
- Visualization of Dijkstra's and A* pathfinding algorithms.
- Comparison of the two algorithms by switching between them.
- Start and Reset buttons to execute the algorithms and reset the grid.

## Requirements

- .NET 5.0 or higher
- Visual Studio 2019 or newer with WPF development support.

## Usage

1. Build and run the project

2. Interact with the grid:
   - Left-click on a cell to toggle an obstacle.
   - Hold `Shift` and left-click on a cell to set it as the start node.
   - Hold `Ctrl` and left-click on a cell to set it as the end node.

3. Use the dropdown menu to switch between Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm.

4. Click the `Start` button to execute the selected algorithm and visualize the pathfinding process.

5. Click the `Reset` button to reset the grid and clear the algorithm's progress.
